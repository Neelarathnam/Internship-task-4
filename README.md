# Task 4 - Binary Classification using Logistic Regression

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. In this task, I built a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

---

##  Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
- **Target Variable:** Diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Steps Performed

1. Uploaded and loaded dataset using `pandas`
2. Cleaned and preprocessed data
3. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
6. Evaluated model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score
7. Tuned classification threshold and explained the **Sigmoid function**

---

##  Model Evaluation

- Evaluation metrics used:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - ROC Curve Visualization

## Output

All results including plots and metrics are shown inside the `.ipynb` notebook.
